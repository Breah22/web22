    <h1>P1.1 Checkpoint 1</h1>
    <h2>Idea 1</h2>
    <p>Sneakers: Write about the history of my favorite pair of sneakers. I was thinking about the evolution of the air jordan series.</p>
    <h2>Idea 2</h2>
    <p>Basketball: Basketball is my favorite sport so i think it might be fun doing a project on the history of Basketball. Or maybe the history of one of my favorite teams logos.</p>
    <h2>Idea 3</h2>
    <p>Nike: The history of the nike logo. The Nike swoosh symbol is one of the world’s simplest but most effective branding visuals.
      Along with athletes and sports followers, millennials like buying products bearing the Nike logo.
      In fact, 62% of the sports shoe market belongs to Nike. The swoosh image has a life of its own as
      it’s already patented and extremely popular.</p>
